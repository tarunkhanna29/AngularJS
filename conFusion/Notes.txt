$scope v/s this
===============
Any function variables linked with this keyword are not available to view via directives, filters, ng-click etc. 
$scope attaches methods/variables to model and model is available to directives/filters and not this keyword.

ng-if v/s ng-show
=================
ng-if will remove element from dom when false but ng-show will not.
So, if any action/event handler is defined on element that is under ng-if and once, it is deleted from dom - that action will be removed and that action will never happen even if ng-if is true later and element is shown again. 
ng-show -> element remains in dom. It's just hide/show.

Child vs Parent Controller
==========================
Child Controller will be able to access scope of parent controller but not vice versa.

Scope
=====
ng-controller and ng-include creates new scope.
